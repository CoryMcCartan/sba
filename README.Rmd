# **sba**: Simple Bayesian Analyses

<!-- badges: start -->
  [![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/CoryMcCartan/sba/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CoryMcCartan/sba/actions)
<!-- badges: end -->

The **sba** package provides Bayesian analogues of common simple analyses like
linear regression and proportion testing. It does so through two interfaces:
one which prefixes common analysis functions with `bayes_`, and one through
a `bayes()` wrapper function which modifies an existing analysis pipeline.

## Installation

You can install the development of **sba** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CoryMcCartan/sba")
```
